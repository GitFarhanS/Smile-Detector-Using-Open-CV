# Smile-Detector-Using-Open-CV

The code is a Python script that uses OpenCV library for real-time face, eye, and smile detection from the video stream of a camera. It starts by importing the cv2 module. It then captures video frames from the default camera (camera index 0) using cv2.VideoCapture() function and loads pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for frontal face, eye, and smile detection from XML files. The frames are converted to grayscale for faster processing using cv2.cvtColor() function. The trainedFaceData.detectMultiScale() function is used to detect faces in the grayscale frames, and rectangles are drawn around the detected faces on the original frames using cv2.rectangle() function with green color and thickness of 4 pixels. For each detected face, the corresponding region of interest (ROI) is extracted, converted to grayscale, and stored in theFace variable. The trainedSmileData.detectMultiScale() function is then used to detect smiles in the theFace ROI, and rectangles are drawn around the detected smiles with blue color and thickness of 4 pixels. The text "smiling" is also added above the face region using cv2.putText() function. Similarly, the trainedEyeData.detectMultiScale() function is used to detect eyes in the theFace ROI, and rectangles are drawn around the detected eyes with green color and thickness of 4 pixels. The processed frames with detected faces, eyes, and smiles are displayed in a window titled 'why so serious' using cv2.imshow() function. The loop continues until the user presses a key to exit. Finally, the camera is released using cap.release() and all open windows are closed using cv2.destroyAllWindows().
